# Old-Webs
A few examples of web pages made by me. They look too vintage for the new web development >~&lt;

WHERE DO I START?!

Yeah, I know this is a mess, but I ain't a nice project developer after all, that's why this looks pretty basic and boring(? I guess.

1. Download ALL the files and put them into a folder.
3. Be carefull, respect the structure of all. Use the same names of folders and all.
2. Start opening the index.html file.
3. Enjoy(?
